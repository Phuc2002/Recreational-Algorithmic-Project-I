# Recreational-Algorithmic-Project-I
**Compose music by solving a Pocket cube**

Use BFS and later optimize by using bidirectional BFS to solve a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube. By carefully assigning certain notes to each cubies' faces, you can compose harmonious melody as you solve the cube. This can be done through analysis between group theory in abstract math and music theory. TED-ed has an awesome video explaining the idea of the project (although it's not exactly the same idea...) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW2Hvs5WaRY 

The focus of the project is on asymptotic complexity analysis.

This is the first project with the idea/theme of exploring the interconnection between CS and other creative discliplines such as art, music, game, etc... (hence the name "recreational"!) using algorithm (hence the name "algorithmic"!).

This is also the first final project for COMP1405/6 combined accelerated course "Intro to CS". 

## Specification
- python 3.6.8
- pygame 1.9.6
- pycharm IDE 2020.1.1

## Notes
- run benchmark.py to see runtime optimization between one-way & bidirectional BFS
- run demo.py to see the cool stuff
- detailed analysis is in the project report PDF.  

## Extension or Update
- create a GUI or use some APIs/framework to have a front-end or further develop it into an application!
